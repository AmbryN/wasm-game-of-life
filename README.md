  <h1><code>Conway's game of life using WASM</code></h1>
</div>

## About

Working repository for the code from the RUST + WebAssembly tutorial which allow to simulate Conway's game
of life in the browser, using Rust to execute the computation and Javascript
to render the result in the browser through WebAssembly.

## Technologies used

* [`JavaScript`](https://www.ecma-international.org/memento/tc39.htmn) for rendering the simulation in the browser
* [`Rust`](https://www.rust-lang.org/) for computing the simulation
* [`WebAssembly`](https://webassembly.org/)
